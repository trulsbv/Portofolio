So my idea with this project was to create a program that would find the word intended by the user, and not necessarily what the user gave as input. The way I was going to achieve this was by haveing a "max score" given by the amount of letters in the word - then check it against words in the list of definitions.
A words of the approriate length would be given points, aswell as correct letters at the correct placements. Approximately half a point would be given to the wrong letters, that was
one key away from the desired one at the keyboard. So {f, t, y, h, b, v} would all be given points if the letter I was looking for was 'g'.

Finally I would look at all the words with the highest score, and display the highest score. This is a far from perfect way to find the wanted word, as a long word would rarely get chosen, and if you missed the first letter, a one letter shorter word with the same ending would
most likely take its place.

Sorbarhet gives the result Robusthet with a 55% similarity, even though Sorbarhet is in reality closer to Sporbarhet


Despite its flaws most of the searches actually find what was intended, and made it easier to find what I was looking for in my own notes
