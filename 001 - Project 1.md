Run "hovedprogram.py" to start the program


My first year at Uni I had a class where we had to do some data conversion and calculation. As a way to spend a lot of time right now in order to save a little bit of time later, I made this program:

Option 1:
This is to find a subnet address when you know your binary IP and binary network mask.

![a'2](https://media.github.uio.no/user/8067/files/57af99c7-7bfa-45c2-b552-ad941d1c836f)

<br>

Option 2:
Quite similar to option 1, but here the answer is inverted

<br>

Option 3:
Option 3 is to calcuate the cost of execution for a program based on the amount of instructions, CPU processing speed (amount of colck cycles needed per instrucion) how often we hit a cache-miss, the penalty of a cache-miss and different kinds of delays. The result is the number of clock cycles needed to execute the program.

Option 4: 
This option finds the missing component X when you have two of three: clock period, delay or frequency.

Here we see a CPU that does work 70% of the time, and a total delay of 15ps (pico seconds). That amounts to a ferquency of 45.46 GHz

![a'4](https://media.github.uio.no/user/8067/files/329f2ea8-4388-47ed-8d12-94545bb2adb0)

In this example we see that a delay of 15ps and 45GHz frequency equals a clock period between 67.5% - 70.7%

![a'5](https://media.github.uio.no/user/8067/files/93710efd-e51c-49f1-a493-7ea6eb97aec1)

Finally we find the delay when we know clock period and frequency
